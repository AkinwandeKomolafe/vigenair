# ViGenAiR - GenAI-Powered Video Ads Editing and Generation at Scale

## Problem

Current Video Ads creative solutions, both in-product and gTech-driven, are
either lacking in features or usability. **95%** of solutions and/or product
features focus on 5 of the 6 Video Ads & YouTube ROI-driving pillars - Ad
Formats, Audience, Reach, Frequency and Flighting. Those 5 pillars contribute to
*only 50%* of the potential marketing ROI, with the 6th pillar - **Creative** -
capturing a *whopping 50%* all on its own.

ViGenAiR focuses on the *Creative* pillar to help potentially **unlock 50% ROI**
while solving a huge pain point for clients; the generation, trafficking and A/B
testing of different Video Ad formats, at **scale**, powered by multimodal
Generative AI (Gemini).

## Solution

ViGenAiR uses multimodal Generative AI to holistically understand and analyse
the content and storyline of a Video Ad, **automatically** splitting it into
*coherent* audio/video segments that are then used to generate different shorter
variants for different Ad formats (landscape, vertical and square assets).

The generated variants may follow the original Ad's storyline - and thus serve
as *mid-funnel reminder campaigns* of the original Ad for
**Awareness and/or Consideration** - or introduce whole new storylines
altogether, all while following Google's best practices for creatives (both the
[ABCD framework](http://go/ABCDs) and the expertise of
[Creative Works](http://go/creativeworks)).
